## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload various audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A, AAC, OGG)
- [ ] Test drag & drop functionality
- [ ] Verify progress tracking accuracy
- [ ] Test all three model variants
- [ ] Validate audio playback for each stem
- [ ] Test download functionality
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify error handling for invalid files

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with large files (approaching 500MB limit)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during processing
- [ ] Test GPU vs CPU processing speeds
- [ ] Verify model loading times

## AI LLM Optimization Opportunities

Based on your rule about suggesting external AI LLM usage to save WARP credits, here are opportunities:

### 1. Audio Enhancement Prompts
For enhancing audio quality post-separation, you could use external AI with this prompt:
```
Analyze this audio stem separation output and suggest specific EQ, compression, and enhancement settings for:
- Vocals: [describe audio characteristics]
- Drums: [describe audio characteristics]  
- Bass: [describe audio characteristics]
- Other instruments: [describe audio characteristics]

Provide specific parameter recommendations for professional audio software.
```

### 2. Model Selection Optimization
For determining the best model for specific audio types:
```
Based on the following audio characteristics:
- Genre: [genre]
- Vocal style: [description]
- Instrumentation: [instruments present]
- Recording quality: [quality assessment]
- Desired output: [intended use]

Recommend the optimal Demucs model (htdemucs, htdemucs_ft, or htdemucs_6s) and explain why.
```

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
For continued UI enhancements:
```
Analyze these user interaction patterns with a stem splitting application:
[paste user feedback or analytics]

Suggest 5 specific UI improvements that would enhance user experience, focusing on:
- Workflow optimization
- Visual feedback
- Accessibility
- Mobile experience
```
